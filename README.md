# Dart Out-of-Bounds List Access
This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: accessing a list element with an index that is out of bounds. The code throws an exception when attempting to access an element beyond the list's valid index range. The solution shows how to handle this by checking the index before accessing the list element, preventing the exception.
